<br> <h3> <i>I strive to teach every child in my care with compassion, integrity, and
   excellence.</i></h3>

<h1> <b> Garner Overton's Teacher Portfolio </b> </h1>

<h4> Welcome to my professional growth portfolio where I will showcase my growth
   and mastery for each of  the 5 Professional Standards.
<br>
<br> The goals I chose this year are: </h4>
<b>Goal 1: </b> I will incorporate a variety of literary skills within math to
  enhance learning.
<br>
<br> Activities/Actions: I will accomplish this by highlighting the literacy components
 of the MVP curriculum in both my Precalculus and Math 3 classes.
<br>
<br> Expected Outcomes/Evidence of Completion: Students will have better understanding
of not only the "what" of mathematics but also the "why" behind the mathematics. This
will allow the students to develop their analytical and communication skills on a deeper
level. This will be evident through students' logical arguments and reasoning in both oral
 and written classwork and assignments.
<br>
<br> Resources Needed: MVP curriculum
<br>
<br> Timeline: August 2018 - June 2019

<br>
<br> <b> Goal 2: </b> The Precalculus/AP Math PLC will adopt strategies from the framework
 of culturally responsive teaching to develop focused purposeful instruction.
<br>
<br> Activities/Actions: I will meet with the Honors Pre-Calculus PLC to develop
instruction that that follows the culturally responsive teaching
 strategies. As a team, we will monitor student performance using formative and common
  summative assessments, especially our targeted subgroups.
<br>
<br> Expected Outcomes/Evidence of Completion: We hope to see improvement in student
performance in our targeted subgroups by using research based strategies in the classroom.
<br>
<br> Resources Needed: PLC Time, Data Discussion Time, Instructional Support, PD from Literacy Coach
